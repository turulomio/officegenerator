Proyect Archived
================

This project has been archived because I've developed a new one called [Unogenerator](https://github.com/turulomio/unogenerator/), that tries to solve problems with OpenPyXl and odfpy libraries limitations, working directly with Libreoffice through UNO api with python, and getting better and more stable results. 

You can still use Officegenerator, it's working fine and it's a good code repository using OpenPyXl and OdfPy.

Give it a try ;)
